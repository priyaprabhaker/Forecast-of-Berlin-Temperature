## Forecast of Berlin Temperature
Berlin Temperature Forecasting with Autoregression

## Project Description:
Overview:
This GitHub repository houses a robust Python program for forecasting Berlin's temperature using time series analysis techniques, specifically Autoregression (AR) models, statsmodels.tsa, partial autocorrelation, and autocorrelation. The project leverages historical temperature data provided by https://www.ecad.eu to generate accurate temperature forecasts for Berlin.

Motivation:
Accurate weather forecasting is crucial for a wide range of applications, from agriculture to energy management. This project aims to develop a reliable temperature forecasting tool using advanced time series analysis techniques. By understanding and modeling the temporal patterns in temperature data, we can provide valuable insights and predictions for future temperature trends in Berlin.

## Key Features:

    # Data Collection: The project fetches historical temperature data from www.ecad.eu, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

    Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

    Time Series Analysis: The core of the project involves time series analysis using Autoregression (AR) models, which capture the temporal dependencies in the data. The statsmodels.tsa library is used for model development.

    Partial Autocorrelation (PACF): PACF analysis is employed to determine the order of the AR model. It helps in identifying the lag values that contribute significantly to the forecast.

    Autocorrelation (ACF): Autocorrelation analysis is performed to understand the correlation structure within the time series data, providing additional insights into the data's temporal dependencies.

    Forecasting: The AR model is used to forecast future temperature values for Berlin. Forecasting accuracy is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

    Visualization: The project includes visualizations to help users understand the historical temperature data, model diagnostics, and forecasted values.
